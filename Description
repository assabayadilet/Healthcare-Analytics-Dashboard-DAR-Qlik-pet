	The project must be structured using the DAR method (Dashboard, Analysis, Reporting).
	  It must include a separate “Description” sheet that contains:
	    •	The subject area of the project.
	    •	The target audience.
	    •	The key questions the application aims to answer.
	Key measures and dimensions should be added to the Core Elements section.
	The project must be well-designed and user-friendly for the end user:
	•	Labels for measures and dimensions must be correctly formatted.
	•	Charts and visuals should not display technical names such as Sum(Sales) or Date.autocalendar.Year.
	•	Sheet names must be meaningful.
	•	Every chart and graph must have a clear title.
	Each sheet in the application should include:
	•	A short description of its purpose.
	•	A cover page or header.
In all other aspects — you have full creative freedom.
